This is my solution for the Insight Data Engineering Coding Challenge.

Here is one thing to keep in mind:

The system I ran this on is Linux (I use Ubuntu 14.10).

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM

In the command line just type the following to give execute permissions to the run script:

chmod 777 run.sh

And then type:

./run.sh

This will run the script and that is all you need.
The program (which is in the src directory) takes an input file and two output files as parameters, and you can see the files in the tweets_input and tweets_output directories.
